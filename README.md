# Evaluating-Air-Quality-A-Classification-Approach-to-Predict-Carbon-Monoxide-Levels

## Overview

In this project, we delve into the practical application of Logistic Regression, a fundamental algorithm in the Machine Learning landscape, especially powerful in tackling classification problems. We provide a thorough explanation of the basics of Logistic Regression, walking through the step-by-step process of building, training, and evaluating a Logistic Regression model. Furthermore, we showcase the application of both linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms, shedding light on their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use-cases.

## Logistic Regression(linear algorithm): A Hands-on Python Tutorial
One of the highlights of this project is a detailed, hands-on tutorial of Logistic Regression in Python. By using a simplified example, we will illustrate the intricate workings of Logistic Regression and familiarize you with the end-to-end process of building a machine learning model â€“ starting from preprocessing and feature selection to model training, evaluation, and fine-tuning.

## Real-world Application: Predicting Carbon Monoxide Levels
To show the utility of Logistic Regression in tackling real-world issues, we apply this algorithm to the AirQualityUCI dataset. Our goal is to predict whether the level of Carbon Monoxide (CO) in the air is high or low based on the concentrations of various air pollutants like NO2, CO, SO2, etc. The classification is binary: 'high' (1) represents dangerous CO levels that exceed the standard range (0.06 to 0.14 mg/m3) and 'low' (0) indicates levels within the safe range.

In this section, we will also illustrate the use of the scikit-learn library in Python for configuring and training our Logistic Regression model.

## Why this Project?
By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of Logistic Regression as a versatile machine learning algorithm, and you will be equipped with the skills to apply, configure, and interpret this model using Python and "scikit-learn". Furthermore, you will be familiar with the broader landscape of linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms, understanding their differences and the scenarios in which each type excels.
