# Evaluating-Air-Quality-A-Classification-Approach-to-Predict-Carbon-Monoxide-Levels

Overview

In this project, we delve into the practical application of Logistic Regression, a fundamental algorithm in the Machine Learning landscape, especially powerful in tackling classification problems. We provide a thorough explanation of the basics of Logistic Regression, walking through the step-by-step process of building, training, and evaluating a Logistic Regression model. Furthermore, we showcase the application of both linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms, shedding light on their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use-cases.
